How to Compile/Run the Enhanced Scientific Calculator
Requirements:
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

Steps to Run:
1. Unzip the Source_Code_Lastname_Firstname.zip file to a directory.
2. Open the command line and navigate to the directory containing the unzipped files.
3. To view the calculator, open the index.html file in your preferred browser. For example:
   - Windows: Type "start index.html" in Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - Linux/MacOS: Type "xdg-open index.html" or "open index.html" in the terminal.
4. The calculator will load and display on the screen. Use the on-screen buttons or your keyboard (Enter to calculate, Escape to clear) to operate.
5. Any errors in the expression (e.g., mismatched parentheses, invalid tokens) will be reported directly in the display.

This project does not require any compilation as it is built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
